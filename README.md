3D Car Chase Game 🚗💥


Welcome to 3D Car Chase Game, a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping 3D car chase game where you must outsmart and evade a chasing car to survive. This is my first game, built with a focus on exciting mechanics and immersive gameplay.

🕹️ Game Overview


In this game, you're in control of a player car being pursued by an enemy car. The goal is simple: avoid collision with the enemy car or the edges of the environment. Collide with either, and you'll trigger a bomb explosion, restarting the game. Test your maneuvering skills and see how long you can survive!
